# Organ Donation Management System (C++ Project)

This is a console-based Organ Donation Management System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and file handling.

## Features
- Add and manage donor information (name, age, organ, blood group)
- Add and manage recipient information
- Perform blood type compatibility checks
- Track and update organ inventory
- Store all data in text files using file I/O (`ofstream`, `ifstream`)
- Menu-driven system for smooth user interaction

##  Concepts Used
- Classes & Objects
- Encapsulation
- File Handling
- Conditional Logic
- Menu-driven console UI

## File Structure
- Donor.cpp / Donor.txt: Donor class
- Recipient.cpp / Recipient.txt: Recipient class
- OrganInventory.cpp`: Inventory and compatibility logic
- main.cpp: Program execution and menu system
- donors.txt / recipients.txt: Data storage

## How to Run
1. Compile using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Dev-C++, Code::Blocks)
2. Run the executable in your terminal or IDE
3. Follow on-screen menu instructions

##  Future Improvements
- Admin login system
- Organ match history logs
- GUI-based interface (using Qt or C++/CLI)
